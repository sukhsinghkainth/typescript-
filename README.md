# typescript-

typescript is the superset of the javascript 
Static checking :-
many languages built in static checking just like java , golang  
it's just for static checking type script is used for static checking it analyze the code as we write (type) 
we use TSX for typescript 

we write type-script then it's compiled to the javascript , it is the development tool only it's still runs js
it's wrapper around the js 

example : - 
```typescript 
let user = {name : "sukh" , age: 29}
let email = user.email // error
```
here we got an error

>how to install ?
there will be two different installation

global installation ,  
first of all install node just go to the nodjs website and just install and agree all kind of stuff 

>npm install -g typescript
  for globally install typescript write following command in terminal 

typescript 
```typescript 
let user = {name: "sukh", age:10}
console.log("helo")
console.log(user.age)
```
it's a classic code of  javascript 
but this hole thig can not be executed at all in  the ts format it's not going to work if we put it into production 

and there tsc works 
>tsc  -- name the file --
its convert your type script into javascript

## types in javascript 
>number string boolean

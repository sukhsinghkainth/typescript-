# TypeScript

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, providing static checking and additional features. It is often used for larger codebases where static analysis can catch potential errors before runtime.

## Static Checking

Many programming languages, such as Java and Go, incorporate built-in static checking. TypeScript brings this feature to JavaScript by analyzing the code as it is written, enforcing type safety. For static checking, TypeScript utilizes TSX, an extension of JSX, commonly used with React.

```typescript
let user = { name: "sukh", age: 29 };
let email = user.email; // Error: Property 'email' does not exist on type '{ name: string; age: number; }'.
```

In the example above, TypeScript catches the error, providing valuable feedback during development.

## Installation

### Global Installation

Before installing TypeScript, ensure Node.js is installed on your system. Visit the Node.js website to download and install Node.js. Afterward, execute the following command for global TypeScript installation:

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```

This installs TypeScript globally, making the `tsc` command available in the terminal.

## TypeScript Usage

Once TypeScript is installed, you can create TypeScript files with a `.ts` extension. For example:

```typescript
let user = { name: "sukh", age: 10 };
console.log("hello");
console.log(user.age);
```

This code, written in TypeScript, will not run in a production environment. To convert it to JavaScript, use the TypeScript compiler (`tsc`):

```bash
tsc yourfile.ts
```

This compiles the TypeScript code into JavaScript, allowing it to be executed.

## Types : 

## Types

In TypeScript, there are various types that you can use:

- `number`
- `string`
- `boolean`
- `Null`
- `undefined`
- `void`
- `Object`
- `Array`
- `Tuples`
- `never`
- `unknown`

## syntax

```typescript
let varableame: type = value
```
### example

```typescript
let greeting: string = "hello ji"
console.log(greeting)
```
Running the file with `tsc` will create a new JavaScript file. To avoid the error "cannot redeclare block-scoped variable 'greetings'", add `exports {}` at the end of the file.


later on if we assign number to the greeting it's not allowed in the typescript 
and if we add dot . in greetings it's show all the methods of the string it's actuaclly gives suggestions if we write wrong in methods 

#number 

how to define no 

```typescript
let userId: number = 333333
```
use `userId.` and use any method suggested there 
like `userId.toFixed()`

even you don't need to put : everytime ts is smart enough to detect the type 

if we simply use 

```typescript
let userId = 33333
```
### it's automatically detects its a number 

#boolean 

```typescript
let isloogedIn: boolean = false
```

# any 
## it's a not a good practise to use any keyword 

### exmple here
```typescript

let hero ;
function getHero(){
return "shaktimaan"
}
hero = gethero()

// here when we hover on the hero it's show's the type as any
we relly want to avoid these cases 
```
### when in such situations where typescript can-not find out what value came up later on in future , it puts that as any which is a kind of a gateway from doing the things any is used whenever you don't want a particular value to cause typechecking errors. it's is  not a special type we assign not a string not a boolean it's simply a marker in the TS it's basically of the typechecking 


```typescript

let hero: string ;
function getHero(){
return "shaktimaan"
} 
hero = gethero()

```

# how functions are defined ?

### example : - 
```typescript 
function addTwo(num){
return num +2 
}
addTwo(5)
```
it might be ok we add a number to it 
but the problem is if we hover over it it show us --any--

 ```typescript 
function addTwo(num){
num.toUpperCase()
return num +2 
}
addTwo(5)
```
### like here we can simply assign values like toUpperCase() to  a number 

in the case of variables , it's optional , it infers 
the type really nicely so there is no problem , in the case of functions, it is really compulsory to define the type

## if we have multiple parameters we are simply define type to the individuls
like we done in signUpUser funciton given below :

```typescript
function signUpUser(name: string , email: String, password:string ){
 console.log(name,password,email)
}

signUpUser("sukh","sukh@email.com","1234")
```

### if we want to pass only two values ? how can we pass the default value ?

```typescript 
function signUpUser(name: string , email: String, isPaid:boolean = false ){
    console.log(name,isPaid,email)
   }
   
   signUpUser("sukh","sukh@email.com")
```

simply provide the default value 
here is the new question arrived 
see the following code 

```typescript 
function addTWo(num: number){
    return "hello"
}
addTWo(6)
```
here we can't get any error which is concern for us this will break entire application since we return a string that's why typescript used 

**how to solve ?** 
```typescript
 function add(num:number):number{
    return "hello"

//we can't just return string here

   }
   console.log(add(2))
```

**how we do it in an arrow function ???**

-`here is how :-`

```typescript
 const getHello(s:string):string => {
 return "" }
```
# map function in typescript 

```typescript
const heros =['skhtiman',"spidormon","ironman"]
heros.map(heros=>{ return `heros is ${heros}`})
```
if we hover over map function it automatically predicts  that hero is going to be the type of string because this array is of type of string 

if we change array 

`heros = [1,2,3]`

it will show us automatically changes the type of array as number 

## but one thing which you should be really careful is the return type of this method 

```typescript
const heros =['skhtiman',"spidormon","ironman"]
heros.map((heros):string =>{
return 1 )
```
here it's give us error because we define the return type as string 

it's a good practice to explicitly metnion whoever is using this function knows more about the defination of the funciton
so if the function returns void  that means it's not going to return anything ever 

#### never 
neither it's void because void means return nothing , but there is never as well, which never return a value very close to void but it's use to handle some kind of error 

a function user never as return type `throw` an exception or terminates execution of the program 

## objects

```
const usr ={
    name:"sukh",
    email:"sukh@gmail.com",
    isActive:true
}
```

desigining an object like this doesn't really make sense and you won't be using it too much . the use case of the object is through the functions you have to actullay pass the objects into the funtions or you have to return some objects through the function 

```
function user({name:string, ispaid:boolean}){  
}

user({name:"sukh",ispaid:true})
```

now we can see a function returning a object here it is 
```
createCourse():{}{}
```
the first {} is return type  and second {} is for function defination  


function example 

```
function createCourse():{name:stirng, price:number}{
    return {name:"reactjs",price:300}
}
```


this is not ecceptable 
```
createCourse({name:"sukh",price:233,email:"sukh@gmail.com"})

```
we can only pass the parameters that function accepts this is not allowed 

### odd behaviour (bad behaviour of object) :-
```
let newuser = {name:"sukh",ispaid:false,email:"s@s.com"}

createuser(newuser)
```

here this time i am able to pass much more information than what is expected in the function defination previously it was giving error 


-----------

# type alias

 itâ€™s common to use the same type more than once and refer to it by a single name. it's a keyword in typescript 

```ts
type User ={
    name: string;
    email:string;
    isActive:boolean 
}
```
advantage of craeting a type like this is whenever there are methods like
 ```js
function createUser(user:User):User{
    return {name:"",email:"",isActive:ture}
}

createUser({name:"",email:"",isActive:true})
```  

the return type of the function should also the User


  we want all the information to pass  what we are doing interlly is kind of creating the data types here 


-----------
# read only and optional

readonly is the keyword you can just put it on to anyoene and now you won't be able to change that 
 
```ts
type User ={
    readonly _id: string
    name: string;
    email:string;
    isActive:boolean 
    creditDetail?: number // This property is optional
}

let myUser : User ={
    _id : "123",
    name : "sukh",
    email : "s@gmail.com",
    isActive : ture,
}

// we cam say that 

myUser.email = "sukh@gmail.com"

// but in case of 

myUser._id = 123


```

`creditDetail?: number`
is the syntax to make optional

## array

```ts
/**
 * Array Declarations:
 */

// An array of strings representing superheroes.
const heroes: string[] = [];

// An array of numbers representing the powers of superheroes.
const heroPower: number[] = [];

// An alternative syntax using the Array type to declare an array of numbers representing hero abilities.
const heroAbility: Array<number> = [];

// Adding elements to arrays.
heroes.push("spiderman");
heroPower.push(33);

/**
 * Two-Dimensional Array:
 */

// A two-dimensional array representing colors and numerical values.
const twoDimensionArray: number[][] = [
    [255, 255, 255],
    [24, 2, 3]
];

type User = {
    name: string;
    email: string;
};

// An array of users.
const allUsers: User[] = [];

// Adding a user to the array.
allUsers.push({
    name: "sukh",
    email: "sukh@gmail.com"
});

```

## union 

instead of using any its highely recomend to use union datatype , which allows you to be into situation where we are not sure what type of data come in it might be a number or a string a combination of two three or more types of data you can include into a variable or an array 

```ts

let score : number|string = 33

score = "string"

//now score can use either  string or a number
// don't add more than three datatypes 

```
---
## Using Union for types 

```ts

type admin = {
    username : string,
    id : string
}
type user = {
    name : string ,
    password : string
}

//user sukh can be a user and a admin  

let  sukh  : user | admin = {name:'sukh',password:"123"}

```
#### one more example 

```js
function DbConnection(id: string|number)
{
    return console.log(`db id is ${id}`); 
}

DbConnection("3")
DbConnection(2)
```


we can use `|` for make union 

# Union in Arrays
We can use union types in arrays by specifying the valid data types within parentheses and separated by `|`

## Example: Array with Union Types
typescript
```ts
const data3: (string | number | boolean)[] = ["2", "2", 3, true];
```

---
here we can assign `string` `number` `boolean` in array

syntax of using union 

```js
(string|number|...more)
```

---
# tuple

it's just an array a kind of specialized array that is given to us by `typescript` with some restrictions on it 

tuples are used when we want data in precise order usually in `API` call because the `API` structure data is always in a very specific fomat 


```ts
let User :(string|number)[] = ["1",2]

// here is the example of tuple 

let Tuple:[string,boolean,number]=["sukh",true,2]

// we can use push method even we try tuple 
Tuple.push(true)

// at index[0] string index[1] boolean index[2] number 

// we can't chage the order 
```

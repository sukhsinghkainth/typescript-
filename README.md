# typescript-

typescript is the superset of the javascript 
Static checking :-
many languages built in static checking just like java , golang  
it's just for static checking type script is used for static checking it analyze the code as we write (type) 
we use TSX for typescript 

we write type-script then it's compiled to the javascript , it is the development tool only it's still runs js
it's wrapper around the js 

example : - 
let user = {name : "sukh" , age: 29}
let email = user.email 

here we got an error from typescript as there is not any email option there is user
